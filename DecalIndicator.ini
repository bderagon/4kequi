Overview
--------

	The decal indicator is 4 concentric circles textured in such a way that a repeating
	texure is UV animated towards the center. It is not a particle effect, but a specially generated procedural object
	that works independantly of other visual effects. 

Section: DecalIndicator

	This section defines properties common to all indicators. The entries have the following purposes:
	
	* Additive : Set this to 1 to enable additive rendering mode for the decal, 0 for alpha blend.
	* PointCount : This is the number of points that the decal will use to define the circle indicators. There are four 
		circles that reprsent the ring, each has their fade level determined by the fade/opaque settings above.
		
Sections: DecalDefault, Decal1, Decal2, etc. These section names match the db strings.

	These sections can be used to configure the decal indicators differently for each type.
	DecalDefault will be used when no specific decal was specified to be used.
	The entries have the following purpose:
	
	* Texture : The prefix of the texture to use. ".tga" is appended before opening. If FrameCount is 
		above zero, it will format the filenames as "Texture%d.tga" to allow you to load any number of
		frames of animation to use for the indicator. Please note that this is a fairly memory intensive
		way to animate a texture so limiting the number of frames is a good idea. Performance may vary
		dramatically for various cards.
	* FrameCount : How many frames of texture to try to load. 
	* Duration : How many milliseconds to show each frame of the animated texture. A value of zero will cause
		a new frame to be selected with each targetting change.
	* TwistFactor : This is a control value that is intended to control how fast each circle of vertices
		in the target indicator rotates on the Z axis relative to each other. Changing this to any value 
		besides 1.0 will probably not produce anything worth looking at, but it won't break anything either.
	* TwistSpeed : This value was intended to rotate the entire indicator on the Z-axis but unfortunately
		it does not work as intended at this time. This will get corrected in the future but for now you 
		probably want to just leave it at 0.0 unless you want the target indicator to "pulse". 
	* TextureScale : How much of the entire texture is visible at one time.
	* TextureSpeed : How fast to move the texture towards the center in texels/msec.
	* ScaleMin : Not used at this time. This and the other two scale values were intended to be used
		to expand the ring when targets are changed, but unfortunately this part was not completed. 
	* ScaleMax : Not used.
	* ScaleSpeed : Not used. 
	* Alpha : The transparency, combined with any texture alpha values.
	* Red, Green, Blue : Tinting (ie. Vertex color) for the ring.
	* FadeStart : How far from the target does the ring begin to fade out.
	* FadeEnd : The distance of the last visible point on the ring.
	* OpaqueStart : The distance from the target that the ring begins to become visible.
	* OpageEnd : The distance from the targe that the ring is fully visible
	* InitialLength : This is an override on the FadeEnd value, and is intended to be used to make the 
		ring quickly expand to full size using the GrowSpeed as the rate of expansion.
	* GrowSpeed : How fast to expand the target ring to full size. A value of 1 will make it instantly appear.
	* FloorOffset : How far off the ground to place the ring.
